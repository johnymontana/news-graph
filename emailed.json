therefore, most important  cinematic questions of our time: Can a movie maintain the dramatic integrity of a theme-park ride? In the case of Gore Verbinski's film, the answer is sure. Mr. Verbinski's penchant for logistics combined with the producer Jerry Bruckheimer's desire to spend like a drunken pirate when it comes to putting everything onscreen melt into an often frenetic, colorful and entertaining comic adventure. The dazzling, high-flying silliness is quite an achievement:  the movie is better than it deserves to be, given its origins. In fact, there's enough storyline for several movies. The wiry and beauteous tomboy Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) owns a medallion that gets the plot going roughly a scant hour into \u0026quot;Pirates.\u0026quot; The pirate Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) kidnaps Elizabeth because of the medallion, which turns out to be an enchanted piece of gold that can free Barbossa and his swabbies from their curse. They're the larcenous undead whose skeletons can be seen in the moonlight. But the movie belongs to Johnny Depp as the pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow. Gargling his consonants before spitting them out, Mr. Depp suggests a man who has spent either a great deal of time with Keith Richards after a tour of the Rebel Yell factory, or a man who has spent a great deal of time watching Mike Myers do his Keith Richards impression. — Elvis Mitchell","des_facet":["MOTION PICTURES","Reviews"],"org_facet":[],"per_facet":["Depp, Johnny","Verbinski, Gore","Knightley, Keira"],"geo_facet":[],"media":[],"eta_id":0},{"uri":"nyt://article/be38fab7-9684-5a21-a6b5-79dd02ae96c7","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/16/dining/taiwanese-cuisine.html","id":100000008477602,"asset_id":100000008477602,"source":"New York Times","published_date":"2022-08-16","updated":"2022-08-18 01:04:31","section":"Food","subsection":"","nytdsection":"food","adx_keywords":"Restaurants;Taiwanese-Americans;Good to Eat Dumplings (Emeryville, Calif, Restaurant);Pine \u0026 Crane (Los Angeles, Calif, Restaurant);California;Los Angeles (Calif)","column":null,"byline":"By Tejal Rao","type":"Article","title":"In a Tense Political Moment, Taiwanese Cuisine Tells Its Own Story","abstract":"The relationship between the island’s cooking and the food in mainland China is complex.","des_facet":["Restaurants","Taiwanese-Americans"],"org_facet":["Good to Eat Dumplings (Emeryville, Calif, Restaurant)","Pine \u0026 Crane (Los Angeles, Calif, Restaurant)"],"per_facet":[],"geo_facet":["California","Los Angeles (Calif)"],"media":[{"type":"image","subtype":"photo","caption":"At Good to Eat Dumplings in Emeryville, Calif., the chef Tony Tung stretches a raw dumpling into shape.","copyright":"Mark Davis for The New York Times","approved_for_syndication":1,"media-metadata":[{"url":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/17/dining/17taiwanese-cuisine1/15taiwanese-cuisine1-thumbStandard.jpg","format":"Standard Thumbnail","height":75,"width":75},{"url":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/17/dining/17taiwanese-cuisine1/15taiwanese-cuisine1-mediumThreeByTwo210.jpg","format":"mediumThreeByTwo210","height":140,"width":210},{"url":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/08/17/dining/17taiwanese-cuisine1/15taiwanese-cuisine1-mediumThreeByTwo440.jpg","format":"mediumThreeByTwo440","height":293,"width":440}]}],"eta_id":0}]}
